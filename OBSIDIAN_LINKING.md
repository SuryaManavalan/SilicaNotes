# Obsidian-Style Note Linking Implementation

## âœ… What's Implemented

### 1. Link Syntax Support
- `[[Note Title]]` - Links to a note by its exact title
- `[[Note Title|Display Text]]` - Links with custom display text

### 2. Automatic Link Processing
- **When**: Links are processed automatically before saving (both auto-save after 10s and manual save)
- **Where**: In `components/notes-app.tsx` - both `updateNote()` and `saveNoteImmediately()` functions
- **How**: Uses `processNoteLinks()` from `lib/obsidian-links.ts`

### 3. Visual Feedback
- **Link Counter**: Shows number of detected links in the editor toolbar
- **Tooltip**: Hover over the link counter to see which note titles are detected
- **Real-time**: Updates as you type

### 4. Graph Integration
- **Automatic**: Links saved to database are automatically used by the graph view
- **Mode**: Graph defaults to "Database" mode to show these connections
- **Real-time**: Graph updates when you switch between notes

## ðŸ§ª Test Data Added

Created 5 interconnected test notes:
- **Project Overview** - Links to JavaScript Fundamentals, React Components, Database Design, API Development, User Authentication, Performance Optimization
- **JavaScript Fundamentals** - Links to React Components
- **React Components** - Links to JavaScript Fundamentals, API Development, Performance Optimization  
- **Database Design** - Links to API Development
- **API Development** - Links to Database Design, React Components

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. **Create/Edit a note** with Obsidian-style links:
   ```
   This note references [[Another Note Title]].
   
   You can also use [[Note Title|custom display text]].
   ```

2. **Save the note** (auto-saves after 10s or Ctrl+S for manual save)

3. **Links are automatically extracted** and saved to the database

4. **View in Graph** - Switch to graph view to see the connections

5. **Visual feedback** - The link counter in the toolbar shows detected links

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Files Modified/Added:
- `lib/obsidian-links.ts` - Core link extraction and processing logic
- `components/notes-app.tsx` - Integrated link processing into save functions
- `components/note-editor.tsx` - Added visual feedback for detected links
- `pages/api/notes.ts` - Already handles the `links` field in API
- `lib/database.ts` - Already has link management functions

### Link Processing Flow:
1. User types `[[Note Title]]` in editor
2. `extractObsidianLinks()` detects the syntax in real-time (for UI feedback)
3. When saving, `processNoteLinks()` finds matching note IDs
4. Links array is updated and saved to database
5. Graph view automatically uses these database links

### Database Storage:
- Links stored as JSON array of note IDs in `links` column
- Example: `[1125899906842628, 1125899906842629]`

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Clickable Links**: Make `[[Note Title]]` clickable in the editor to navigate
2. **Auto-completion**: Suggest note titles when typing `[[`
3. **Backlinks**: Show which notes link to the current note
4. **Link Validation**: Highlight broken links in red
5. **Bulk Link Updates**: Update links when note titles change

## âœ¨ Ready to Use!

The system is fully functional! Try editing the test notes or create new ones with `[[Note Title]]` syntax to see the linking in action.
