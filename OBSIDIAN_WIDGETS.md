# Obsidian Link Widget Implementation

## ✅ What's Implemented

### 1. Clickable Link Widgets
- `[[Note Title]]` and `[[Note Title|Display Text]]` render as stylish Badge components
- **Ctrl+Click** (or Cmd+Click on Mac) to navigate to the linked note
- **Cursor proximity editing**: When cursor is near the link, it reverts to editable text
- **shadcn/ui theming**: Uses Badge and Input components for consistent styling

### 2. Visual Feedback
- **Link counter**: Shows number of detected links in toolbar
- **Hover effects**: Links have hover states using theme colors
- **Selection indication**: Selected links show with ring styling
- **Debug logging**: Console logs show navigation attempts and success/failure

### 3. Navigation System
- **Custom events**: Widget dispatches `obsidian-link-navigate` event
- **Case-insensitive matching**: Finds notes by title regardless of case
- **Debug info**: Logs available notes and navigation attempts

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Create or edit a note with Obsidian links
Use the existing test notes or create new content like:
```
# My Note

This references [[JavaScript Fundamentals]] and [[React Components|React]].

Also check out [[Database Design]].
```

### 3. Test the functionality
- **See the styling**: Links should appear as styled badges
- **Check link counter**: Toolbar should show number of detected links
- **Test navigation**: Ctrl+Click on a link to navigate
- **Test editing**: Click near a link to edit the raw syntax

### 4. Debug navigation issues
Open browser console to see:
- `🔗 Obsidian link clicked: [Note Title]`
- `📡 Navigation event received: [Note Title]`
- `🎯 Attempting to navigate to: [Note Title]`
- `✅ Found target note` or `❌ Note not found`

## 🎨 Styling Details

### Widget Appearance
- Uses `Badge` component with `secondary` variant
- Primary theme colors for consistency
- Hover effects with `hover:bg-primary/10`
- Selection ring with `ring-primary/50`

### Link Counter
- `Badge` with `outline` variant
- Shows link icon + count
- Tooltip shows detected link titles
- Cursor help indicator

## 🔧 Architecture

### Components
- `ObsidianLinkComponent` - React widget for rendering links
- `ObsidianLinkSimple` - TipTap extension (simplified version)
- `inline-widget-base.ts` - Base class for future inline widgets

### Event Flow
1. User Ctrl+Clicks link widget
2. Widget dispatches `obsidian-link-navigate` event
3. Note editor receives event and calls `onNavigateToNote`
4. Notes app finds matching note and updates `selectedNoteId`

### Files Modified
- `components/editor/obsidian-link-widget.tsx` - Link widget component
- `lib/extensions/obsidian-link-simple.ts` - TipTap extension
- `components/note-editor.tsx` - Added navigation handling
- `components/notes-app.tsx` - Added navigation logic
- `app/globals.css` - Added widget styles
